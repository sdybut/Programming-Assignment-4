# Programming-Assignment-4

#### Before anything else, import the pandas library *import pandas as pd* since it will be used in all problems. We will also use Matplotlib *import matplotlib.pyplot as plt* but **only in Problem 2** for the charts. Then load and display the data.

 **Code**

     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #import the Matplotlib library as 'plt'
     import pandas as pd #import the pandas library as 'pd'

     bd = pd.read_csv ('board2.csv') #Read a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame
     bd #print
     
 **Output**

### Problem 1
a. Filters the table to Instrumentation students from Luzon with Electronics > 70, then shows only their Name, GEAS, and Electronics.

 **Code**

      bd.loc [(bd['Track'] == 'Instrumentation') & # keep only Instrumentation track
       (bd['Hometown'] == 'Luzon') & # also keep only that are from Luzon
       (bd['Electronics'] > 70), # And also the ones with Electronics greater than 70 only
       ['Name', 'GEAS', 'Electronics']] # show only these columns
       
 **Output**

  <br/>

b. Creates an Average per student (mean of Math, Electronics, GEAS, Communication), then keeps female students from Mindanao with Average â‰¥ 55 and shows Name, Track, Electronics, and Average.<br/>

**Code**

     bd['Average'] = bd[['Math', 'Electronics', 'GEAS', 'Communication']].mean(axis=1) #compute the average of all the subjects per examinee and then add it as a new column

     bd.loc [(bd['Gender'] == 'Female') & # keep only female students
       (bd['Hometown'] == 'Mindanao') & # also keep only that are from Mindanao
       (bd['Average'] >= 55), # And also the ones with the Average of greater than or equal to 55 only
       ['Name', 'Track', 'Electronics', 'Average']] #show only thhese columns


 **Ouput**

### Problem 2
A visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade. Does chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contributes to a higher average score?<br/>
  a. Average by Track: Groups by track and draws a bar chart of the mean Average for each track.<br/>

**Code**

    bd['Average'] = bd[['Math', 'Electronics', 'GEAS', 'Communication']].mean(axis=1) #compute the average of all the subjects per examinee and then add it as a new column

    avg = bd.groupby('Track')['Average'].mean() # Compute the mean or 'Average' for each Track
    
    plt.bar (avg.index, avg.values, color = ['skyblue', 'salmon', 'bisque']) # Draw one bar per Track using its mean and also assign custom colors (order follows avg.index)
    plt.title('Average by Track') # Add title to the chart
    plt.ylabel('Mean') # Label the y-axis to show mean values
    plt.xlabel('Tracks') # Label the x-axis to show the categories
    plt.show() # display

**Output**

  <br/>

  b. Average by Gender: Groups by gender and draws a bar chart of the mean Average for each gender.

**Code**

    avg = bd.groupby('Gender')['Average'].mean() # Compute the mean or 'Average' for each Gender

    plt.bar (avg.index, avg.values, color = ['skyblue', 'salmon', 'bisque']) # Draw one bar per gender using its mean and also assign custom colors (order follows avg.index)
    plt.title('Average by Gender') # Add title to the chart
    plt.ylabel('Mean') # Label the y-axis to show mean values
    plt.xlabel('Gender') # Label the x-axis to show the categories
    plt.show() # display

**Output**

  <br/>

  c. Average by Hometown: Groups by hometown and draws a bar chart of the mean Average for each region.<br\>

**Code**

    avg = bd.groupby('Hometown')['Average'].mean() # Compute the mean or 'Average' for each Hometown
    
    plt.bar (avg.index, avg.values, color = ['skyblue', 'salmon', 'bisque']) # Draw one bar per gender using its mean and also assign custom colors (order follows avg.index)
    plt.title('Average by Hometown') # Add title to the chart
    plt.ylabel('Mean') # Label the y-axis to show mean values
    plt.xlabel('Hometown') # Label the x-axis to show the categories
    plt.show() # display

**Output**

**Conclusion**

To conclude, this Pandas program uses subsetting, slicing, and indexing to extract specific data from the cars DataFrame. The first task displayed the first five rows with odd-numbered columns using .iloc[]. The second task filtered the DataFrame to show the row of the car model Mazda RX4. The third task identified the number of cylinders of Camaro Z28 using .loc[]. Finally, the last task displayed both the cylinder count and gear type of Mazda RX4 Wag, Ford Pantera L, and Honda Civic. These operations demonstrate how Pandas makes it easy to access and analyze precise parts of a dataset.
